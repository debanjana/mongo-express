# mongo-express

In this project I continue to explore communicating from your Node application to the MongoDB server. 
I achieve : 
    1. Develop a Node module containing some common MongoDB operations
    2. Use the Node module in your application and communicate with the MongoDB server
    and 
   3.  Avoid callback hell by using promises
